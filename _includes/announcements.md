#### Community Cleanup - April 22

Our annual community cleanup will be April 22 from 8AM-12PM. We desperately need your help!  Show up any time you like, and we'll:

* Give some of you gloves and bags, and we'll tidy things up. 
* Give others some information to share with neighbors, spreading the word on how to help keep our neighborhood clean.
Please, come and help make a difference in the community!
