<img alt="Flowers" src="images/flower_bucket.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px; float:right;"/>Of course none of this would work without volunteers. Take a turn on one of our committees, help us plant some flowers in the spring, or come to get the fun started at one of our parties.  Your association is really just a group of neighbors working together.

A list of ongoing activities for which volunteers are needed is included in the [Volunteer List](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=529E6218CA92DA58%211545).

The easiest way to get involved is to attend one of our board or committee meetings listed on the [assocation calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/hosted/pinewoodgreens.com/embed?src=pinewoodgreens.com_8dlgr29ukho8ps0v8dumvs4hq0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York).
