title: Keep Alert for Water Leaks
---

Unfortunately, when our houses were built in the 1970s, the builder used plastic pipes to bring water into the house from the meter. Over time, many of these pipes have failed, particularly on Trevino, Sikes, January, Blocker, Norsham, Middlecoff, and Hyson.

These leaks cost home owners hundreds of dollars extra in water bills and, without proper insurance, thousands to repair.

You may have a leak if you see:

* A sudden increase in your water bill.

* Water pooling around the meter cover in your front yard

* Water leaking onto the sidewalk and dribbling out into the street.

* Water ponding in your back yard or on the commons behind your fence.

In two steps, you can confirm easily if you have a leak. First, find the main water valve in your house and shut it off. In some houses this valve is found on the front basement wall; in other houses the valve is in your utility room. Next, open the water meter box in your front yard. If you aren’t comfortable doing this step, call Fairfax County Water Authority (703-698-5600). When you look at the meter inside, if you see any dials or numbers moving, you may have a leak.

If you have a leak or rupture, call a plumber quickly. Even a small water leak can seep hundreds of gallons of water underground – putting your home’s foundation at risk. It could also rupture at any point, potentially flooding your home or your neighbor’s.

The typical cost for this repair is several thousand dollars.

This is typically not covered by home owner’s insurance; however, there are some insurance companies which provide coverage for water lines. Some home owners have used Dominion, with very positive reviews. Dominion charges under ten dollars a month, which considering the average cost of repair of over $3000, is worth consideration.
