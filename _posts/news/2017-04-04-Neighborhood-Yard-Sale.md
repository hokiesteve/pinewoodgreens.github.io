title: Neighborhood Yard Sale - May 6
---

The annual neighborhood yard sale will be May 6 from 8AM-12PM. Clear out some space in your home and make some money! In the past, we have averaged around 30 homes that participate, and it's a lot of fun.

Here's what we'll do:

* Advertise it online and on the streets
* Arrange to have a collection truck from Unique Thrift Store parked by the office 

Here's what you can do:

* Start getting ready now. You may be surprised how much extra stuff you have. 
* Set up on street corners. It's hard to get shoppers to come into cul-de-sacs. 
* Set up early. Some of the best sales happen then.
* Consider donating what you don't sell. 
* Spread the word!
