title: Winter is here - Information about our Snow Removal Services
---

We never quite know if we will see any snow, but it’s smart to be prepared! Here’s what you need to know:

- We contract for snow removal for all private roads owned and maintained by Pinewood Greens Homeowners Association.  
- Hyson Lane and Snead Lane are state owned and maintained roads.  Since VDOT is responsible for plowing Hyson and Snead, we can't control when they are plowed.  (You can check on the status of VDOT cleared roads here: http://www.vdotplows.org/)
- When it snows, our priority is to remove the snow from the main roadways to ensure emergency access.
- Snow removal will commence upon a 2" accumulation and will continue every 4" until precipitation stops.
- Snow plowing of streets will be cleared to allow 2 vehicles to pass except between 2801 Hogan Court - 7821 Beard Court where it will be cleared curb to curb.  All vehicles should be properly parked to avoid damage or being towed. 
- The snow plows only clear a path in the middle of the street.  They do not remove all the snow behind cars parked in parking spaces.  Any remaining snow behind your vehicles will be your responsibility to remove.   When digging out your car, refrain from dumping snow in the street.  Instead, please move snow to common areas or your front yard.
- The main sidewalk along Hyson Lane and around the school bus stops will also be cleared upon a 2" accumulation with the main goal to have a clear walk way.
- Each homeowner is responsible for clearing the sidewalk in front of their home and it is encouraged that this be completed within 48 hours after the storm passes. 
- In the event of an extremely heavy snow event, as we saw in January 2016, weather conditions may impact plow equipment availability or may exceed the capabilities of available equipment during the snow storm.  If such conditions do occur, we do ask for your patience throughout the snow storm and afterwards as we work diligently to clear off the roads and make them passable again.
