title: Pool Season is Almost Here
---
Pool season is almost here.  To enjoy this great neighborhood benefit, a pool pass is required from each member of your household for entry into the pool. Passes are issued each pool season, so you are required to apply each year.  Pool passes are available to full-time residents and their caretakers.

For this year, we've created a [new online application form](http://goo.gl/forms/A1Sl467NwK) to help speed the process.

Please also review the [pool rules](https://goo.gl/KTdthd) again with your household.  We want everyone to have a great time.  It's important that everyone follow the rules so that we also have a safe time too.

We hope to see you all there this summer.
