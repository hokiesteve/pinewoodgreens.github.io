title: Introducing our New Email Platform
---

We are rolling out a new platform for email communication to keep you better informed of everything happening in the neighborhood.  This  greatly enhances our ability to reach you with important information about our neighborhood services, social events, and work performed by our contractors that may be impactful to residents.

This new platform also makes management of our mailing lists much easier for both you and us.  If you are not on our list, [subscribe today]({{site.url}}/subscribe.html).
