title: Concrete Work on Middlecoff (October 17-20)
---

Concrete work on sidewalks, curbs, and gutters will be taking place on Middlecoff beginning Monday, October 17th 
and continuing through Thursday, October 20th.

All cars need to be off the street starting at **6 am** until **5 pm** each day.
_Cars remaining at the start of work will be towed (and subject to a $75 tow fee)._

We recognize the inconvenience this can cause, but maintaining our streets is a big project!
This concrete work is in preparation for full depth ashault replacement coming up in a few weeks.

Please bear with us through the project.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the office at 703-560-8920.
