title: Pinewood Greens Trees
---

There are numerous aspects of our neighborhood that are special. Asked to name a couple and I would not hesitate to name a close-knit community and swimming pool. However, I have also come to appreciate another aspect – our trees.

As our name suggests, Pinewood Greens is home to numerous trees. Our community name is misleading, though, because pines are not the majority of the trees that populate our community anymore. Rather, our community is home to a variety of tree species; including, oak, maple, gum, locust, cherry, elm, poplar, hickory, and ash.

These trees affect each and every one of us. For some, they provide our children a break from the summer sun, for others they shield our homes from the elements, and I even hear that there are companies that really appreciate visiting the tree leaves that accumulate in our gutters two or three times a year.

A recent Washington Post article highlighted a study, finding that neighborhoods filled with trees are good for our health. In other studies, looking at or walking in areas filled with greenery can boost our attentiveness, improve mental health, and even make ourselves feel younger.

These are a few reasons to keep our diverse trees healthy (plus no one likes trees falling on houses, cars, or friends). Over the next few months, work will be completed on our trees to keep them looking and feeling healthy and to keep our community looking and feeling great. 

### Did you know?



Pinewood Greens has many Ash Trees on the property, many of them have dead branches. The dead branches are caused by Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). Emerald ash borer has rapidly become the most important pest of ash trees in North America. Emerald ash borer ( EAB), a native of Asia, had never been found in North America or Europe until it was discovered in southeastern Michigan and Windsor, Ont., in June 2000.

Damage is caused to the ash trees by the EAB larvae, which feed in S-shaped tunnels on the inner bark of branches and tree trunks. The inner bark, called phloem, transports nutrients and water within the tree. Galleries excavated by the flat, cream colored larvae cause branches and eventually the entire tree to die. All true ashes such as green ash, white ash and black ash are susceptible to EAB. Scientists believe that virtually all ash species in North America are at risk if EAB continues to spread. Emerald ash borer does not attack mountain ash and has not attacked other tree species in North America.

Pinewood Greens is doing everything in the HOA’s power to save these Ash Tree’s. We have implemented a closed system Micro-injection of insecticide for systemic seasonal suppression of Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). Micro-injections allow the product to be administered directly in the vascular system which expedites the movement of the product throughout the plant. The work is performed under the guidance of a certified arborist and trained plant health care specialist.
