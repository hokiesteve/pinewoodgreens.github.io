title: Street Work on Middlecoff Place and Trevino Lane (November 14-18)
---

We will be performing concrete and paving work on Middlecoff Place and Trevino Lane (7700-7720) during the week of November 14-18 (Monday - Friday). 
  
All cars need to be removed from the affected streets from 6 am until 6:30 pm each day. Cars remaining at the start of work will be towed (and subject to a $75 tow fee). 

After paving is completed, streets will remain closed for 72 hours (including overnight) for curing. This curing period may extend over the weekend of November 19-20.

The pool parking lot will also be closed for the duration of the project.

We recognize the inconvenience this can cause, but maintaining our streets is a big project! Please bear with us through the project.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the office at 703-560-8920.  Any changes due to weather will be posted on the Pinewood Greens website (www.pinewoodgreens.com).
