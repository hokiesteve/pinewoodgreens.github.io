title: Steps for a Successful Yard Sale
---

- Step one to a good yard sale: gather your stuff early. Less than two weeks to go!

- Step two for a good yard sale: set your prices low. Way low. If you set them too high, many won't buy, since most aren't comfortable haggling.

- Step three for a good yard sale: Advertise! We're advertising online in a few places, including Craigslist, and will be putting up street signs today. Want more buyers? [Advertise yourself!](https://post.craigslist.org/k/6l7chH715BGwu2rYn_4ZcA/rTJ6V?s=edit)
