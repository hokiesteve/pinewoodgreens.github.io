title: Interested in Joining the Pinewood Greens Board of Directors?
---

Pinewood Greens HOA has an opening on the Board of Directors! This is your chance to have a bigger say in how our community is managed.

Our board of directors consists of 9 members with 4 serving as officers.  General management of the association is provided by Community Association Management Professionals (CAMP).  We have a number of regular committees and do our best to make the best decisions we can for Pinewood Greens.

As far as the general commitment goes, we have monthly board meetings and periodic committee meetings, should you join a committee. The annual meeting is coming up in March, which is when the community votes on new Board members. The board term is 3 years, so we elect 3 board members each year as the term expires for 3 sitting board members. (In some years we elect additional board members to fill open seats.) So far this year we have 2 people running for 3 spots.

If you're interested, submit your [application](http://pinewoodgreens.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ccb02905102f08c37b4d2ec3e&id=e67cc17cc4&e=792a03fd13)  form as soon as possible.  

Email office@pinewoodgreens.com for more information and plan on attending the Annual Meeting on March 22 for the vote.
