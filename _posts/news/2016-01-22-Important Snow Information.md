## General Snow Plowing Information

The snow plow contractor will clear snow from our streets (the cleared area will be at least 2.5 car lengths wide) automatically after 2 inches of snow and every 4 inches thereafter until the end of the storm. Given the uncertainty of each storm, more plowing, hand shoveling, and/or salting/sanding of roads may occur.

During snow events let’s come together as a community and help a neighbor dig out, keep the storm drains clean, and make a path to the mail boxes and fire hydrants. You never know how much one act of kindness can help a fellow neighbor.
