title: Pool Season is Here
---

Opening day is Saturday, May 23, at 11 a.m. and all residents with pool passes are welcome.  The application deadline has passed to receive pool passes by opening weekend.  Work to continue issuing passes will resume on Tuesday, May 26, so if you haven't sent your pool pass application in yet, please do so as soon as possible.

The safety of all guests – especially children – is our top priority. It is important that everyone follow the [pool rules](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=529E6218CA92DA58%211547) designed for our safety. Please read and discuss them with the children in your household.

A few all-time favorites:

1) All pool guests must bring a pool pass.

2) All guests must obey the lifeguards. Following pool rules helps everyone swim safely. If the lifeguard is unnecessarily distracted by one guest, the lifeguard isn’t able to effectively watch the others.

3) Children under 12 must be accompanied by an adult or babysitter. To the parents, guardians and babysitters who will be keeping an eye on their children this year, we thank you. Your contribution is very important.
