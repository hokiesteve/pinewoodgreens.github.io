Due to hazardous road conditions, Republic Services will be CLOSED on Tuesday, January 26th, 2016. No residential or commercial services will be performed. As an organization, safety is our top priority, and we do not want to put the public or our employees at risk.

Updates will be forthcoming as those decisions are made.

Thank you and we appreciate your patience and understanding.
