title: Thank You Everyone

We wanted to thank all of those who worked hard shoveling out fire hydrants, storm drains, assisting neighbors digging out, and all the other hard work put in to help clean up from the snow storm.  We very much appreciate the efforts all around the neighborhood during this challenging time.
