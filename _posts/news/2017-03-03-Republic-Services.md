title: Republic Services Yard Waste Collection Changes
---

As of March 1st, 2017, Republic Services no longer services yard waste in plastic bags â€“ clear or dark.  Yard waste should be placed in reusable containers or biodegradable paper bags which can be obtained at many area grocery stores as well as home improvement retailers.  They will service up to 10 bags/containers and/or bound bundles of limbs and branches that are 4ft and under and bound with rope or twine.  

For more details on our yard waste collection please see the Republic Services yard [waste brochure](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ALpMoEbuQ0glR8M&cid=529E6218CA92DA58&id=529E6218CA92DA58%2122404&parId=529E6218CA92DA58%2122403&o=OneUp).
