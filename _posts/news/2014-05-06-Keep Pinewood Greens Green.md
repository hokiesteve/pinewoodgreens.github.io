title: You Can Keep Pinewood Greens Green
---

Many neighbors want to help out in our community without the commitment of joining a committee. These folks are our unsung heroes and you can help too. For example, you can:

* Sweep the sidewalk, curb and gutter area in front of your home. It makes your street look cared for.

* Adopt a spot and plant some grass seed to keep the commons near your home green.

* Help keep our commons clean! We need help every day. Keep your eyes open for fast food bags, stray paper, bottles and cans that litter our community on days in between regular litter pick-ups.

* Lend a hand after spring and summer storms! Thunderstorms can make a mess. Please call the Office if you see major tree damage. Please gather the sticks near your help and pile them on the curb. Weâ€™ll hire someone to haul the mess away.

* There are good folks throughout the neighborhood who help keep Pinewood Greens green every week. You can too.

Thanks.
