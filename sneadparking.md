title: Possible Parking Changes on Snead Ln
---

We recently received a petition submitted by several Snead Lane residents, and need your opinion.  
 
The petition says that it is difficult to park and back out of parking spaces while cars are parked on the inside curb from 7818 Snead Lane to 7800 Snead Lane. So, the petition asks that Pinewood Greens paint the inside of the curb yellow, making it a "no parking" zone, like it is along Hyson Lane. This eliminates about seven parking spaces.  
 
We are collecting input from residents in the neighborhood that may be impacted.  Please let us know your opinion by filling out our [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8YUpiQsqPU2rw5axBuIRNmXC4CnGXxGqiKYFEhBRy6Iw8mg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
